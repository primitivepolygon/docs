# Index Framework

Index Framework is a powerful system that can be used to create source-like **singleplayer** games in ROBLOX. We're no longer developing Index Framework but we've decided to release it to the community. We hope that they can improve it or use parts of it for their own projects. We won't be using Index Framework for any future projects because it's made for a very specific genre and we believe we can create a much more robust and user-friendly framework.

> **IMPORTANT:** Index Framework was never fully completed, so some features are missing. It was also never intended for public release, so you will most definitely run into bugs or elements of the framework that aren't designed for easy usability. Some of the code may be hard to read or not documented with any comments, this is mostly due to rushed nature that this framework was developed in.

> If you're using Index Framework in a game, we would appreciate being credited in the description.
