# 1. Getting Started

1. Get the [PUT LINK HERE Index Editor]() plugin for ROBLOX Studio.
2. Open a new place, go to 'Plugins', look for the 'Setup' button in the 'Index Editor' section and click it.
3. Wait for a few seconds as the plugin inserts Index Framework into ServerScriptService and creates a map folder.
4. A Index Editor window should appear somewhere in your studio instance (you may have to click the 'Editor' button in plugin menu).

You can now start developing with Index Framework.

> We recommend looking at our [PUT LINK HERE Example Map]() to learn the aspects of Index Framework.
