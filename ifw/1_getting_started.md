# 1. Getting Started

1. Get the [Index Editor](https://www.roblox.com/library/7044593840/Index-Editor) plugin for ROBLOX Studio. You also need to own the [Index Framework](https://www.roblox.com/library/7044449225/Index-Framework) model, because the plugin attempts to load it.
2. Open a new place, go to 'Plugins', look for the 'Setup' button in the 'Index Editor' section and click it.
3. Wait for a few seconds as the plugin inserts Index Framework into ServerScriptService and creates a map folder.
4. A Index Editor window should appear somewhere in your studio instance (you may have to click the 'Editor' button in plugin menu).

You can now start developing with Index Framework.

> We recommend downloading our [Crowbar Demonstration Map](https://github.com/primitivepolygon/primitivepolygon.github.io/raw/main/places/CrowbarDemonstration.rbxl) to learn how an Index Framework map functions. We're currently working on another map that includes more features of the framework, this should help a lot with developing your own games.
