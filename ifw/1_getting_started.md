# 1. Getting Started

> **IMPORTANT: Weapons/tools DO NOT work correctly.** This is because our group owns all of the game animations, and due to the way roblox works, this means they can only be used by us. To get around this, you can reupload the animations on to your own account and replace the animation IDs. We don't have a tutorial for this yet, but you can join our [discord server](https://discord.gg/NWhVsUC) to find out more information.

1. Get the [Index Editor](https://www.roblox.com/library/7044593840/Index-Editor) plugin for ROBLOX Studio.
2. Open a new place, go to 'Plugins', look for the 'Setup' button in the 'Index Editor' section and click it.
3. Wait for a few seconds as the plugin inserts Index Framework into ServerScriptService and creates a map folder.
4. A Index Editor window should appear somewhere in your studio instance (you may have to click the 'Editor' button in plugin menu).

You can now start developing with Index Framework.

> We recommend downloading our [Crowbar Demonstration Map](https://github.com/primitivepolygon/primitivepolygon.github.io/raw/main/places/CrowbarDemonstration.rbxl) to learn how an Index Framework map functions.
