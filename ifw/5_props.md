# 5. Props
Props are objects that can be picked up by the player or simply used for decoration. In the spawn tab of the Index Editor, there's a whole section for props. A simple prop to start with is 'prop_crate', which is a simple wooden box. This prop also has a destroyed model, which means it can be destroyed by the crowbar.

Once you've inserted a prop, you can modify the 'Pickup enabled?' option in the settings tab. By default, every prop can be picked up by pressing 'E' when looking at it.
